         <h2>How did I came up with CRASH! Website Creator?</h2>
         <p>So, First off all i came up with <strong>CRASH! Website Creator</strong> <u>by making a website by myself and a bit of help off of youtube and a little 
            known website</u>. And after making the website I thought to myself <strong>"Programming isn't that easy for everyone or beginners</strong>" and that 
            thought made me a bit skeptical. Because in the making of some of my other projects i became hopeless and frustrated if something
            would go wrong, In that time I began to lose hope that I can never learn programming. And after some <strong> and error and a
            couple of tutorials i was able to make a website by myself</strong>. So <strong> learning how to make a website I have decided that I will make a 
            website that wil help others who aren't able to make websites or who don't know how to</strong>.I guess <strong> CRASH! Website creator
            will take care of your website if you assighn me to make one</strong>.
